Coverity Playground - Kill your working hours

    This place will help you play with all the fancy functionalies such as Jenkins, 
    JIRA, Web API, and E-mail notification.

    Jenkins
	
    - Setup Jenkins user to the same as Coverity user at /etc/default/jenkins
        JENKINS_USER=yuan
        JENKINS_GROUP=yuan
    - Change Jenkins file owner to Coverity user e.g.
        chown yuan:yuan /var/lib/jenkins
        chown yuan:yuan /var/cache/jenkins
        chown yuan:yuan /var/log/jenkins
    - restart Jenkins
        sudo service restart jenkins
    - Create freestyle project in Jenkins
    - Run run.sh in Jenkins to initiate Coverity configure/build/analyze/commit
    
    LDAP
    
    - There is really not so much to say about LDAP. Google "LDAP setup" and you will
      find some easy setup for LDAP itself.
    - On CC side, go to system->LDAP configuration->create a new LDAP
      e.g.
    	  Base DN: dc=coverity,dc=com
	  Bind DN: cn=admin,dc=coverity,dc=com
    - Go to Users & Groups, users can be either createdor matched from LDAP
    - Tip: LDAP default user name is initial of first name + las name, like ychen for myself
