Coverity Playground - Kill your working hours

    This place will help you play with all the fancy functionalies such as Jenkins,
    JIRA, Web API, and E-mail notification.

    Work flow

    - developers use run.py to analyse only the modified code by Coverity before
      check-in into git
        - fast incremental build/analyze
        - clean before check-in
        - No inter-procedural defects
    - Server CI runs run.sh for a nightly build and cov-commit-defect to Coverity
      connect

    Jenkins

    - Setup Jenkins user to the same as Coverity user at /etc/default/jenkins
        JENKINS_USER=yuan
        JENKINS_GROUP=yuan
    - Change Jenkins file owner to Coverity user e.g.
        chown yuan:yuan /var/lib/jenkins
        chown yuan:yuan /var/cache/jenkins
        chown yuan:yuan /var/log/jenkins
    - restart Jenkins
        sudo service restart jenkins
    - Create freestyle project in Jenkins
    - Run run.sh in Jenkins to initiate Coverity configure/build/analyze/commit

    - Install and configure Coverity Jenkins plugin
    - Add Coverity in post build actions
      - Specify streams
      - Select defect filter options (e.g. select impact is among 'high')
      - Select 'Fail the build if matching defects are found'
      - The options can take effect without using Coverity plugin to build/analyze/
        commits, etc. You can use your own build scritxl

    LDAP

    - There is really not so much to say about LDAP. Google "LDAP setup" and you will
      find some easy setup for LDAP itself.
    - On CC side, go to system->LDAP configuration->create a new LDAP
      e.g.
          Base DN: dc=coverity,dc=com
          Bind DN: cn=admin,dc=coverity,dc=com
    - Go to Users & Groups, users can be either created or matched from LDAP
    - Tip: LDAP default user name is initial of first name + last name, like
      ychen for myself

    git defect auto assignment

    - Ensure test e-mail is sent and received in email notification and delivery 
    - Projects & Streams -> select stream -> Owner Assignment -> Derieved from SCM
    - The git user name read by Coverity is in e-mail format. Therefore, you need a
      simple mapping in System -> Automatic Owner Assignment
      - Import customized .json file
  Â  - Add cov-import-scm between cov-build and cov-analyze to import SCM data
